# Machine-Learning

This repository contains a collection of Python programs for machine learning, including classification, linear regression, and cost analysis using TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

## Programs

### Classification
The following programs use the Iris dataset and breast cancer prediction:

- Iris Classification: This program uses various classification algorithms to classify iris flowers based on their characteristics such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

- Breast Cancer Prediction: This program uses logistic regression and support vector machines to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not based on features such as the size and shape of the tumor.


### Linear Regression
The following programs implement various linear regression algorithms:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression

### Cost and Error Analysis
The following programs implement cost and error analysis:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) Calculation
- Gradient Descent Algorithm

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
