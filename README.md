# Machine-Learning

This repository contains a collection of Python programs for machine learning, including classification, linear regression, and cost analysis using TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

## Programs

### Classification
The following programs use the Iris dataset and breast cancer prediction:

- Iris Classification: This program uses various classification algorithms to classify iris flowers based on their characteristics such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

- Breast Cancer Prediction: This program uses TensorFlow to train a model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not based on features such as the size and shape of the tumor. The program splits the data set into training and testing sets, trains the model using logistic regression, and evaluates its performance using accuracy and precision metrics.


### Linear Regression
The following programs implement various linear regression algorithms:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression

### Cost and Error Analysis
The following programs implement cost and error analysis:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) Calculation
- Gradient Descent Algorithm

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/Machine-Learning.git
2. Install the required packages using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the desired program.
